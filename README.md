# StockRoom
An inventory management system
The goal of Stockroom, a web-based inventory management system, is to make the process of recording, administering, and arranging stock-related operations more straightforward and user-friendly. The three primary web sections of the system—My Stockroom, Inventory, and New Orders—are each designed to handle a distinct facet of inventory administration.
Key information about recent orders, such as the date of the order, the order number, the customer's name, and the total order value (TOV), may be viewed centrally on the My Stockroom page. This functionality enables users to effectively manage inventory flows and evaluate order information in a timely manner.
A thorough overview of every product that is currently in stock is given on the Inventory page. The product name, price per SKU, and stock keeping units (SKU) are among the important metrics monitored. Through an easy-to-use interface, users can also carry out crucial tasks like changing product information or stock level updates.
The process of generating and overseeing client orders is made easier via the New Orders page. Users can add product quantities, enter customer names, and quickly identify products by scanning product codes. The order generating procedure is subsequently expedited as the system automatically determines the total price based on the units and price per product.
Stockroom caters to small and medium-sized businesses by integrating key inventory management functions with an emphasis on accuracy, efficiency, and convenience of use. Businesses may improve inventory control, lower manual mistake rates, and guarantee efficient order processing by utilizing this platform, which will improve customer happiness and streamline operations.
